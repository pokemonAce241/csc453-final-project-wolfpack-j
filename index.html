    <h3>Description</h3>
    The objective of our project is to “auralize” and “musicalize” IoT data in
    an effort to help the visually impaired “visualize” the data. We have
    created sounds based on data collected from sensors in a particular
    environment that essentially auralizes that environment and its
    characteristics. This technology could be used by anyone for entertainment
    or utility purposes although it is mainly directed towards the visually
    impaired. In the case that a visually impaired person cannot easily navigate
    and respond to their environment, our product could potentially help them.
    This is not necessarily a new idea since things like this have existed for
    ages (e.g. crosswalk alarms), but the way in which we have designed and
    implemented it certainly is. For further details, see our github page:
